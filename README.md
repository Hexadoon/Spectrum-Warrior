# color-coded

This game is going to be more like an action/adventure game about someone trying to understand all "colors" of the spectrum and why they are so chaotic. The player journeys through various "levels" or areas represented by different color palettes. Each area presents its own challenges based on what color theme it is. Once all levels are completed the player is once again swarmed by the chaotic colors from the beginning but this time the player reaches their hand out to the sky and the colors rush around them and up to form auroras that slowly fade.
 
Game is gonna take place in a, hopefully, open world setting with various environments. Third person around-the-shoulder shot. No leveling system but  customizeable color palette for equipment and clothing. Enemies in each area will vary in models. Three basic tiers of enemies: basic, hard, boss. Basic enemies will be simple close-ranged melee monsters. Hard enemies will have tougher melee, ranged, stronger melee (mutually exclusive). Boss enemies will all be unique models that have their own skillset. 
Clearing an area requires defeating each boss and is signified by light beams shooting up into the sky based on the corresponding colors. Levels can be generated procedurally, there can be as many as we'd like, but a minimum of three is needed.


Notes
- Humanoid: Male/female, several head presets for various races
- No UI: Translate health and inventory into visual indicators
- Legend of Zelda style graphics (maybe a step up or so)
- Utilize 3D models online if needed
- Look for various terrains to form regions of open world
